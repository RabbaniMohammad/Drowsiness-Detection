<h1 style="color:red; text-align: center;">Heart Disease Prediction</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 100;">
    The project's goal is to create a machine learning model that can be used to analyze health data and forecast the risk of heart disease. Developing a predictive model, examining and preprocessing the dataset, and assessing model accuracy are among the goals. The predictive model, the data exploration report, and the model evaluation metrics are important deliverables. Healthcare practitioners and data scientists are among the stakeholders, and reaching an 87.5% disease prediction accuracy is the success criterion. The project has a three-month timeline and a budget for preprocessing, building the model, and acquiring data. The leads of the data science teams and project sponsors must give their approval. Budgetary restrictions and presumptions about the dataset's representativeness are examples of constraints. Concerns about data privacy and potential biases that could impair model performance are among the risks.</p>
